    Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been 
    given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world 
    is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for 
    yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. <br>
